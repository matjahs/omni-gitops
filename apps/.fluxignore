⚠️  ARGOCD ONLY - DO NOT DEPLOY WITH FLUX ⚠️

This directory is managed exclusively by ArgoCD.
Flux CD should never deploy resources from this directory.

See .sourceignore in the repository root.

Protection mechanisms:
- .sourceignore excludes apps/ and apps/**
- ArgoCD Applications define source paths explicitly
- Flux Kustomizations use path: ./flux

For more information:
- Flux resources: /flux/README.md
- ArgoCD resources: /applications/README.md (if exists)
