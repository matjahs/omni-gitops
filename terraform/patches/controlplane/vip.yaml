# Talos VIP configuration for Kubernetes API endpoint
# This enables the shared virtual IP (172.16.20.250) on all control plane nodes
# This patch ONLY adds the VIP - static IPs and routes are configured via control_static_ip_patches in main.tf
# Reference: https://www.talos.dev/v1.11/talos-guides/network/vip/
